  TOKEN:
    description: >
      This option defaults to the repository scoped GitHub Token. 
      However if you need more permissions for things such as deploying to another repository, you can add a Personal Access Token (PAT) here. 
      This should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**.

      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions neccersary
      and when generating a new PAT that you select the least permission scopes required.
