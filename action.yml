  ssh-key:
    description: >
      This option allows you to define a private SSH key to be used in conjunction with a repository deployment key to deploy using SSH.
      The private key should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. The public should be stored in the repositories deployment
      keys menu and be given write access.

      Alternatively you can set this field to `true` to enable SSH endpoints for deployment without configuring the ssh client. This can be useful if you've
      already setup the SSH client using another package or action in a previous step.
    required: false

  token:
    description: >
      This option defaults to the repository scoped GitHub Token. 
      However if you need more permissions for things such as deploying to another repository, you can add a Personal Access Token (PAT) here. 
      This should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**.

      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions neccersary
      and when generating a new PAT that you select the least permission scopes required.
