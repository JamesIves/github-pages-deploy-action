# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

## Pull Request Best Practices

1. Ensure that you've tested your feature/change yourself. As the primary focus of this project is deployment, providing a link to a deployed repository using your branch is preferred. You can reference the forked action using your GitHub username, for example `yourname/github-pages-deplpy-action@master`.
2. Make sure you update the README if you've made a change that requires documentation.
3. When making a pull request, highlight any areas that may cause a breaking change so the maintainer can update the version number accordingly on the GitHub marketplace.
