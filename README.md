# GitHub Pages Deploy Action :rocket:

[![View Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-action-blue.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action.svg)](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action/issues)

This [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) will handle the building and deploying process of your project to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It can be configured to upload your production ready code into any branch you'd like, including `gh-pages` and `docs`. This action is built on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), which means that you can call any optional build scripts your project requires prior to deploying.

## Getting Started :airplane:
You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) supports. If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you.

```workflow
action "Deploy to GitHub Pages" {
  uses = "JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@master"
  env = {
    BUILD_SCRIPT = "npm install && npm run-script build"
    BRANCH = "gh-pages"
    FOLDER = "build"
  }
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

If you'd like you can combine it with the filter action so it only triggers deploys on a specific branch. You can find an example of this below.

```workflow
workflow "Deploy to Github Pages" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["Deploy to gh-pages"]
}

action "master branch only" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "branch master"
}

action "Deploy to gh-pages" {
  uses = "JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@master"
  env = {
    BRANCH = "gh-pages"
    BUILD_SCRIPT = "npm install && npm run-script build"
    FOLDER = "build"
  }
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  needs = ["master branch only"]
}
```

## Configuration üìÅ

The `secrets` and `env` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. Below you'll find a description of what each one does.

| Key  | Value Information | Type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`  | In order for GitHub to trigger the rebuild of your page you must provide the action with a GitHub personal access token. You can [learn more about how to generate one here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This **should be stored as a secret.**  | `secrets` | **Yes** |
| `BRANCH`  | This is the branch you wish to deploy to, for example `gh-pages` or `docs`.  | `env` | **Yes** |
| `FOLDER`  | The folder in your repository that you want to deploy. If your build script compiles into a directory named `build` you'd put it here. | `env` | **Yes** |
| `BASE_BRANCH`  | The base branch of your repository which you'd like to checkout prior to deploying. This defaults to `master`.  | `env` | **No** |
| `BUILD_SCRIPT`  | If you require a build script to compile your code prior to pushing it you can add the script here. The Docker container which powers the action runs Node which means `npm` commands are valid. If you're using a static site generator such as Jekyll I'd suggest compiling the code prior to pushing it to your base branch.  | `env` | **No** |
| `CNAME`  | If you're using a [custom domain](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), you will need to add the domain name to the `CNAME` environment variable. If you don't do this GitHub will wipe out your domain configuration after each deploy. This value will look something like this: `jives.dev`.  | `env` | **No** |
| `COMMIT_EMAIL`  | Used to sign the commit, this should be your email. If not provided it will default to your username. | `env` | **No** |
| `COMMIT_NAME`  | Used to sign the commit, this should be your name. If not provided it will default to `username@users.noreply.github.com`  | `env` | **No** |

With the action correctly configured you should see something similar to this in your GitHub actions workflow editor.
